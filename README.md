# check-IP-by-country

Simple script which scans an entire .csv file for IP addresses and uses a commercially available free [endpoint](https://freeipapi.com) to check the country of origin. 
As part of the terms of service, you're not allowed more than 60 requests per second, so the script is throttled accordingly.
